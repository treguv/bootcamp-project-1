# Fly High

## Purpose
The purpose of this webpage is to provide the current weather conditions for kite flyers to help them determine if they should go kite flying or not. It also keeps track of their recent searches, while also providing the ability to save their favorite locations and easily come back to them. 

## Note
We understand that deploying the application with exposed API keys is bad practice. However, due to the fact that at this time we do not have access to any back-end to host the keys we have no alternative to deploying them in the webpage.
